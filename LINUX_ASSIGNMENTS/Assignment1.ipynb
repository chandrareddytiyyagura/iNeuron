Also known as the command line, it is a facility which lets you instruct your OS using text.

This is called a desktop environment in Linux and there are plenty of options including KDE, Unity and Cinnamon. A desktop environment is usually bundled with a number of applications including file and web browsers plus a couple of games.\n",

Individual applications, however, can and there are thousands for Linux just like Windows and Apple’s OS X has thousands of applications. Most Linux distros have app stores which help you find and install apps, for example Ubuntu Software which comes with Ubuntu."
