    "- An inode is an index node. It serves as a unique identifier for a specific piece of metadata on a given filesystem. Each piece of metadata describes what we think of as a file. That's right, inodes operate on each filesystem, independent of the others.\n",
    "- Process identifier, also known as process ID or PID, is a unique number to identify each process running in an operating system such as Linux, Windows, and Unix. PIDs are reused over time and can only identify a process during the lifetime of the process, so it does not identify processes that are no longer running."
